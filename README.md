# INCOMELYZER-AI-POWERED-SALARY-PREDICTION-USING-ML-MODELS

# Incomelyzer ðŸ’¼
**Insightful salary analysis + prediction in one app**

## Overview
Incomelyzer is a complete machine learning project for predicting employee salary categories (>50K or <=50K). 
It combines data analysis in a Jupyter Notebook and an interactive Streamlit web app.

## Project Structure
- `Incomelyzer_salary_prediction_FIXED.ipynb` : Full EDA, feature engineering, ML model comparison with plots.
- `incomelyzer_final.py` : Streamlit app for single & batch predictions with model selection.
- `adult 3.csv` : Dataset used for training and predictions.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- SVM
- Neural Network (MLP)
- Decision Tree
- XGBoost

## How to Run
### Notebook:
Open Jupyter Notebook and run `Incomelyzer_salary_prediction_FIXED.ipynb` to see analysis and model training.

### Streamlit App:
```bash
streamlit run incomelyzer_final.py
```
